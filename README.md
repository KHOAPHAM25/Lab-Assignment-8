# Lab-Assignment-8

I did the assignment and the input4 did correctly, but the first 3 i believe came out with faults. However, i was notified we were given an error code whoch didn't help us at all in the print array as it can only read 100 integers while the first inputs only has 10. I hope i get good amount of points for effort and for good foraat as it actually runs.
